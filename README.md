# SuicidePrevention

For our project, we created a dataset of variables that have correlation to the suicide victims from multiple government and private websites.
Some of the factors we took into consideration are: Mental Health Expenditure,Drug Addiction, Happinness Index, Literacy Rate, Population.

We did data manipulation and webscraping to come up with the final dataset.
